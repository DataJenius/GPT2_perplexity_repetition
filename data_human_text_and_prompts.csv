Tale of Two Cities,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.",118,611,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was ",21,Dickens
Dr. Seuss ,"At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no birds ever sing excepting old crows... is the Street of the Lifted Lorax. 

And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the Lorax away. 

What was the Lorax? And why was it there? And why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows? The old Once-ler still lives here. 

Ask him, he knows. 

You won't see the Once-ler. Don't knock at his door. He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store. He stays in his Lerkim, cold under the floor, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof. And on special dank midnights in August, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the Lorax was lifted away. He'll tell you, perhaps... if you're willing to pay.",178,954,At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows ,12,The Lorax
The Bible,"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.",179,921,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.,30,"Genesis 1, KJV"
Douglas Adams,"""Forty-two!"" yelled Loonquawl. ""Is that all you’ve got to show for seven and a half million years’ work?""

""I checked it very thoroughly,"" said the computer, ""and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve never actually known what the question is.""

""But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!"" howled Loonquawl. 

""Yes,"" said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, ""but what actually is it?""

A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other. 

""Well, you know, it’s just Everything… Everything…"" offered Phouchg weakly. 

""Exactly!"" said Deep Thought. ""So once you do know what the question actually is, you’ll know what the answer means.""",137,806,"""Forty-two!"" yelled Loonquawl. ""Is that all you’ve got ",4,Hitchhiker's Guide
CNN,"Having arrived in China as the most successful country in Winter Olympics history, Norway was quickly into the groove on day one of Beijing 2022 as the Nordic country got off to a golden start on Saturday.

Norway claimed two gold medals on Saturday to take its all-time gold tally to 134 -- that's 29 more than the United States, which sits in second on 105.

Therese Johaug won the first gold of Beijing 2022 with a dominant victory in the 15-kilometer cross-country skiing race in the women's skiathlon, the Norwegian cruising to her first individual Olympic title in 44 minutes and 13.7 seconds.

The 33 year old is competing in her third Games, but missed PyeongChang 2018 due to a positive drug test in 2016.",126,709,Having arrived in China as the most successful,1,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/05/sport/beijing-winter-olympics-day-one-spt-intl/index.html
Reddit,"Yes! This! I wanted to say that the thing I wanted more than anything (other than snacks, haha) when I was pregnant was connection and understanding from my husband. He was great about it too. Listen to her concerns, any that she brings up, take them seriously, don’t deride her or dismiss her. Get curious about what she’s curious about- if she’s reading a pregnancy and parenting book, buy yourself a copy and read it with her. If she wants to talk about plans, participate and plan with her. Let her take the lead on deciding what’s important right now- don’t push her to think the way you’re thinking. The first trimester is so exhausting, I’ve never been more tired in my life. It leaves no energy for anything- every little thing takes so much energy and it barely leaves you with enough energy to even think. So if you can ease the mental and emotional burden like the above poster said, you’ll be doing her a huge favor and you two will grow closer in the process.",178,973,Yes! This!
