The Chinese Army is an army with a long history of military history. The Chinese Army is one of the oldest military organisations in the world and the first in human history.

The PLA has made significant changes under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) following the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. The CPC has been in power since 1949 and has overseen the creation of a modern military, the Chinese Army.

The PLA has grown to over 2 million soldiers and have a relatively small size of less than 100,000 soldiers when compared to other major countries in the world. China is the largest contributor to the international war effort in the world with over two thousand military bases in more than 70 countries. The PLA also has more than two million trained soldiers and troops.
